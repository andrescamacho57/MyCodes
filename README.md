# MyCodes
Python scripts I've written

Hi! Thank you for taking some time to look through this repository. Here you will find codes I've used to manipulate data, clean it up, draw insights, etc. I have several codes that
use a Pandas dataframe to accomplish this and others that use xlswriter and xlsxread to read an excel and write to a new one the information I want. There are a few machine learning 
code examples as well icluding linear regression, multiple, logistic regression, and Gauss Naives Bayes. Both of which make predictions on a car make based on other input car data. 

Thanks!
